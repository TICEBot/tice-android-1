In this release we have done the following:
- We fixed a bug that caused the onboarding to fail under certain circumstances (e. g. a poor internet connection).
- When there can't be resolved an address for a given location we now show you at least the corresponding coordinates.
- The performance of the app has been improved when switching to foreground.
- Many small bugs have been fixed.

If you encounter a bug or want to share your thoughts on TICE feel free to reach out to us.
